# Welcome!

Hello! Iâ€™m Yuwei(Vivian) Xia, and this is my personal website. 

I am currently a student in MS Data Science Program in Department of Environmental Health at Columbia University. 
I like painting and dancing during my leisure time. I am also a "Gourmet". I often go out with friends for exploring delicious food when we are free.

I have a very cute dog called "Caizhuyou":
